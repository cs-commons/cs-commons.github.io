# Prerequisites

To work with CS Commons sites and artifacts, you need the following software installed:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

Ruby, Jekyll, and Git should be available from whatever software package manager you're using.  Here are some examples for specific systems:

## Debian and Ubuntu Linux

Run the following command:

    sudo apt-get install ruby jekyll git

(If you are running Debian and you don't have `sudo` installed, run the above command without `sudo` in a root shell.)

## Other flavors of Linux

Use your package manager to install Ruby, Jekyll, and Git.

## Windows

See the Jekyll on Windows page:

* <http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/>

The best option is probably [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com).  From the Cygwin setup program, install the `git` package from the Devel category, and the `ruby` package from the `Ruby` category.

Some web pages for installing Jekyll on Cygwin:

* <http://www.4thinker.com/ruby-on-cygwin.html>

## MacOS X

The generic Jekyll installation instructions should work fine:
