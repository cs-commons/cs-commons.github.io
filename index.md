# What is CS Commons?

CS Commons is a mechanism for sharing, discovering, and reusing Computer Science course materials, such as assignments, labs, and lecture notes.

If you've ever thought to yourself that it would be really cool if there were an easy way to use course materials written by other people, and to share materials you've developed, that's exactly what CS Commons is intended to be.

# How does it work?

CS Commons consists of *sites* and *artifacts*.

A CS Commons artifact is a self-contained chunk of content such as an assignment, lab, or set of lecture notes.  Each artifact is explicitly designed to be reusable.

A CS Commons site is a website, typically for a Computer Science course.  CS Commons artifacts can be easily imported into a site and customized for that site.

CS Commons sites and artifacts are designed to be searchable.  It is easy to find artifacts (to import into your own site) and sites (to serve as examples of what other people are doing in their courses.)

# Tell me more!

CS Commons leverages existing technologies to make creating, publishing and using reusable course content easy and fun.

CS Commons sites are developed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  Jekyll uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a simple and elegant markup language.  Each CS Commons site and artifact is a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository.  Although you can publish a CS Commons site on any web server, you will almost certainly want to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to publish your site.  By using GitHub and GitHub pages, you can publish your site for free, and you will also enable other people to find your CS Commons sites and artifacts.
